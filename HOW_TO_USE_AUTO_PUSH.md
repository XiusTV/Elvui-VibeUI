## 💬 How to Use (Super Easy!)

**Just tell me in Cursor and I'll handle the git commands:**

- "Push my changes"
- "Commit and push pfQuest-wotlk"
- "Push my ElvUI updates to GitHub"
- "What changed in my repos?"
- "Show me git status"

**You never need to type git commands yourself!**

## 🔧 What's Under the Hood

Each repository has:
- Git repository initialized
- Connected to your GitHub account
- Post-commit hook that auto-pushes after each commit
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude temp files

---

## 📝 If You Want to Push Manually

```bash
cd "E:\Games\Ascension\Live\Interface\AddOns\[ADDON_NAME]"
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
# Auto-pushes to GitHub!
```

But remember: **Just ask me instead!** 🎯

**All done! Just say "push my changes" whenever you're ready!** 🚀
